"""The hint of the target switch (option touchless_target, L + D-pad up): a D-pad glyph with only its up arm
lit, in the item selector's L bar, to the left of the target face (docs/hud_layout.md, "Target switch hint").

The game has no "D-pad up" glyph, so one is drawn into a free corner of the quest texture qst00_ID and a
sprite showing it is added to the layout ui205, animated like the bar's Y button glyph (shown only while
the bar opened with L is open). Each language has three identical copies of qst00_ID under the same path
(GLYPH_ARCS); the game uses whichever is loaded first, so the glyph goes into all of them.
