@ Shows / hides the top-screen copy of the target camera panel with the
@ touch-screen panel and the top-screen HUD (docs/hud_code.md, "Target face on
@ the top screen").
@
@ The game shows and hides its GUI groups with FUN_00ae53e0(group, visible).
@ The first instruction of FUN_00ae53e0, `push {r4, r5, r6}` at 0xAE53E0,
@ becomes `b` to this routine, which looks at the calls that change a group's
@ visibility:
@   - a group of the ui601 binder (0x1085650: panel00, panel01, target00):
@     its copy gets the same (panel00 / panel01 -> the copy of panel00, the
@     only face shown on the top screen; target00 -> the copy of target00),
@     but it is only shown while the HUD is. Every frame the panel update
@     (FUN_00b93788) hides the three groups and shows the needed ones, so the
@     copies end every frame as the touch-screen panel does;
@   - the HUD's health bar (ui202_tairyoku, *(0x1083EDC), in the ui202
@     binder): when it is hidden (FUN_00b8e0b8 while loading an area, menus,
@     cutscenes; FUN_00b826bc then skips the panel update), both copies are
@     hidden. The mirror (target_face.c) shows them again with the HUD.
@ Then it runs the original function.
@
@ FUN_00ae53e0 is a leaf (r0 group, r1 visible; it pushes r4-r6 only), so
@ `body` (the replaced instruction + a branch back) can be called like it.
