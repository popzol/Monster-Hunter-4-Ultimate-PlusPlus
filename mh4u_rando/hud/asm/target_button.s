@ L + D-pad up switches the large-monster target (docs/hud_code.md, "Target switch").
@
@ FUN_00b94854 (target camera panel) already has a button shortcut: when the
@ GUI "pressed" buttons of the pad (pad + 0x348) contain 0x8000 and a setting
@ byte (*0xFB6B7C + 0x2B) is 1, it sets panel + 0x27E = 1, which makes
@ FUN_00b8d074 switch the target exactly like a tap on the panel. The test at
@ 0xB948AC is replaced by `bl` to this function and a branch on r0:
@     r0 != 0 if asm/dpad_filter.s saw L held + D-pad up pressed, or the original test.
@ dpad_filter.s runs in the player's per-frame action copy and leaves the
@ request in FLAG (a free word at the end of .bss); it is consumed here, so a
@ press switches once. Only r0, r1 and r12 are used (the caller reloads r0).
