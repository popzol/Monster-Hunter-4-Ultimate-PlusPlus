@ With L held, the D-pad does not move the camera; L + D-pad up asks for a
@ target switch (docs/hud_code.md, "Target switch").
@
@ FUN_00b1cdf0, the player's input update in a quest (once per frame), copies
@ p + 0x3D0 into the actions p + 0x3CC and then ORs more actions into them:
@ FUN_00b28f54 the item mode (0xA00, actions 9 and 11, while L is held),
@ FUN_00b3d160 L + A / Y / X, and FUN_00b3cc64 the D-pad and the C-stick: the
@ D-pad from the game-layout buttons held (p + 0x3A0) and pressed this frame
@ (p + 0x3A4), up 0x2000, down 0x1000, left 0x800, right 0x400, into actions
@ 1-8 (the camera moves on 2 / 4 / 6 / 8); the C-stick from its analog state.
@ Its call at 0xB1D0B0 is replaced by `bl` to this wrapper (r0 = the hunter).
@ For the local hunter in item mode (action 11 or L held, game bit 0x8), the
@ D-pad bits are hidden from FUN_00b3cc64, so only the C-stick sets actions,
@ and target_request = D-pad up pressed this frame (else 0), which asm/target_button.s
@ consumes. The button words are restored afterwards.
