"""Executable patches of the HUD size option (exefs/code.ips), for the update's code.bin.

Minimap icons: the map layouts are shrunk by data towards the map's top-right
corner, but the code places the minimap icons (ui250) every frame for the
full-size map, and likewise the visible circle of the stage map shown without
the Map item. These eight call sites of FUN_006c40e0 (world -> map
projection) are redirected to a wrapper (asm/minimap_wrapper.s) that maps the
projected position the same way. See docs/hud_layout.md, "Minimap".

Mount gauge: FUN_00b98454 moves the monster face (ui204_face) along the bar
with x = 45 - 98 * progress, in pixels; both constants of its literal pool are
scaled (the gauge's anchor is x = 0). Its bar fills are scales, so they follow
the data.

Target switch (not part of the HUD size): FUN_00b94854 runs the touch-screen
target camera panel and has a button shortcut test; it is redirected to
asm/target_button.s, which also accepts L held + D-pad up. That request comes from
asm/dpad_filter.s, a wrapper of the player's D-pad / C-stick action mapping, which
also keeps the D-pad from moving the camera while L is held (the C-stick still does).
See docs/hud_code.md, "Target switch".

Target face: a second instance of the target camera panel's layout (ui601) is
loaded on the top screen at fixed GUI manager slots (asm/face_loader.s,
released by asm/face_free.s, hidden with the touch panel by asm/face_show.s),
and asm/target_face.c shows one face of the touch-screen instance on it every
frame, left of the item selector. See docs/hud_code.md, "Target face on the
top screen".

The added code lives in the executable's free space, placed by the code space
manager (mh4u_rando/exefs/code_space.py, docs/code_space.md): this module only
names its blocks. Each patch places and hooks only its own blocks, so they can
be applied in any order and next to other changes.

Addresses are virtual (file offset + 0x100000) in the update's executable
(0004000E00126100); the base game's code differs and is not supported yet.
Every patched place is checked first, so another executable is rejected
instead of being corrupted.
