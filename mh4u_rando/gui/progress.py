"""Semi-fake progress bar animation (no tkinter, so it can be tested headless).

The real work is fast and uneven, so the bar does not show raw progress:

* each pipeline stage has a checkpoint (CHECKPOINTS); while a stage runs, the
  bar creeps towards the next checkpoint ever more slowly (it never reaches it);
* when the stage really ends, the bar jumps to that checkpoint;
* every stage stays on screen at least MIN_STAGE_SECONDS, so a fast run still
  shows the whole sequence; real quest progress is a floor inside "quests";
* at the end the bar rushes to 100 % and only then reports "finished".
